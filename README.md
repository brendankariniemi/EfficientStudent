This project is a simple angular application that I created to complete my assigments in a timely matter. It includes a daily calandar on which you can add your class lecture times, study blocks, due date reminders, etc. I have also included a todo list alongside a pomodoro timer so that you can complete the most urgent assignments without getting distracted or brain fog.
